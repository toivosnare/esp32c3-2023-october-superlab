RTIC Exercise 2 - Reliable Serial Communication

The exercise is implemented in the dev branch of the repository
https://github.com/toivosnare/esp32c3-2023-october-superlab/tree/dev


Implemented
  - serial communication from host to target
  - command processing (Set command fleshed out, Get command on a working level, but the returned data is placeholder)
  - peripheral control: time, blinkers, RBG led
  - error handling for serialization/deserialization
  - testing of a few commands from main
